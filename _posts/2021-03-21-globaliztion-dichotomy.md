[A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence): "Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications. Ours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live." 


Since the dawn of the 21st century, the shift away from nationalist views and widespread adoption of the internet has paved the way for globalization. While many governments preach globalization, geographical governance serves as the antithesis of this effort. 

Everything can be classified as a transaction of some sort. A business transaction represents the trading of goods while a relationship represents the trading of emotional share. Therefore, in it's essence globalization is a movement that aims to connect people from all corners of the worlds with one another and allow them to transact. The growth of global transactions can be followed closely by the rise of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies which allow people to conduct secure, inter-country transactions without needing a middleman to guarantee it. Furthermore, the increasing value and reach of Facebook, Whatsapp, Twitter, etc... which facilitate inter-country emotional transactions indicate the consumer interest in non-business globalization. 

As the world continues to grow vertically through means of the internet, global methods of governance stagnates. While, a Russian and an American gamer can connect and become friends without ever meeting each other due to innate similarities in their personalities, they are subject to two completely different modes of governance. When two very similar people are governed by different forms of government one of them is bound to be misgoverned. While this is an incredibly micro example, imagine this same effect on a much larger scale such as what happens in the EU countries. As blockchain techonlogy begins to pervade throughout mainstream technological systems and people are given control over their digital footprint, a new form of digital, dynamic governance will need to develop to avoid this ongoing dichotomy of governance and globalization.
