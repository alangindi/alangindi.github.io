Since the dawn of the 21st century, the shift away from nationalist views and widespread adoption of the internet has paved the way for globalization. While many governments preach globalization, geographical governance serves as the antithesis of this effort. 

In our world everything can be classified as a transaction of some sort. A business transaction represents the trading of goods while a relationship represents the trading of emotional share. Therefore, in it's essence globalization is a movement that aims to connect people from all corners of the Earth with one another and allow them to transact. We see this spectrum of different global transactions taking effect in the rise of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies which allow people to conduct secure inter-country business without needing a middleman to guarantee it. Furthermore, the value of Facebook, Whatsapp, Twitter, etc... which allow people to achieve those inter-country emotional transactions with one another indicates the growth of the non-business side of globalization. 

[A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence): "Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications. Ours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live." 

As the world continues to grow vertically through means of the internet, global governance stagnates. While, a Russian and an American gamer can connect and become friends without ever meeting each other due to innate similarities in their personalities, they are subject to two completely different modes of governance. When you have two very similar people that are governed by two different forms of government one of them is bound to be misgoverned and this is happening at a much larger scale worldwide. As blockchain techonlogy begins to pervade throughout mainstream technological systems and people are given control over their digital footprint, a new form of digital governance will need to develop to avoid this ongoing dichotomy of governance and globalization.
